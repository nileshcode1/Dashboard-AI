This project is a simple, responsive dashboard UI built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, featuring charts created with **Chart.js** (via `react-chartjs-2`), and a responsive navigation bar with a hamburger menu for mobile devices.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The dashboard adjusts gracefully to different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS. On smaller devices, content switches to a vertical layout, and a hamburger menu is used for navigation.
- **Bar and Pie Charts**: Displays a bar chart for monthly income and expenses and two pie charts for income distribution and household expenses, created with `react-chartjs-2`.
- **Responsive Sidebar**: A sidebar menu featuring several navigation links that stack vertically on mobile devices.
- **User Profile Section**: Displays a user profile card with recent financial activities.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the components.
- **Chart.js (react-chartjs-2)**: A charting library for creating the bar and pie charts.
- **React Router DOM**: For navigation between pages in a React application.
